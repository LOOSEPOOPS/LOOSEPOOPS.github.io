                <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> is exploring this space through a collaboratively-authored, semianonymized collection of ekphrastic collage.
                At the event, <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> will have craft supplies, photographs, and words that will, with the audience's assistance, be made into art.
                <strong>The audience is encouraged to participate in the event while watching the other performers and to assist in displaying the resulting artwork in hearts, on walls, and under rivers.</strong>
