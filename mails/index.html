                &gt; All of <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> are alumni or current students at NAU. We have multiple publications in literary journals, as well as experience in national and international conferences. We can provide specific CV information upon request from the SSOO selection committee.<br />
                &gt; <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> is an artist collective based out of Flagstaff, AZ. It currently consists of<br />
                &gt;<br />
                &gt; <span class="redacted">Case Duckworth</span><br />
                &gt; <span class="redacted">Melanie McCuin</span><br />

                &gt;<br />
                &gt; and others. <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> focuses on art in the now, art as-lived, art as an event that cannot be captured, but must be lived.<br />
                &gt;<br />
                &gt; Work info:<br />
                &gt; We'll have an exhibition of collectively-composed poetry, collage, and chapbooking from the month of April. The method involves each member of the collective photographing their lives in April with disposable cameras, culminating in a simultaneous composition event where we develop the film, shuffle it, and write ekphrastics on the photographs. We'll take those photographs and ekphrastics and collage them into a new collaborative piece, and take that piece and chapbook it.<br />
                &gt;<br />
                &gt; We can do any of these steps at SSOO-related events, or display the final product (as it so stands) at a gallery. We envision each step to be a creative happening, and will be able to incorporate the audience at any step.<br />
                &gt; We shouldn't need any assistance, and it should only take us about a half-hour to set up.<br />
                &gt;<br />
                &gt; For performances ranked first to last:<br />
                &gt; May 16th<br />
                &gt; May 23rd<br />
                &gt; May 9th<br />
                &gt;<br />
                &gt; For non-performances:<br />
                &gt; May 14th<br />
                &gt; May 21st<br />
                &gt; May 7th<br />

                &gt; Links (if no files attached):<br />
                &gt; Because this work hasn't been created yet, we don't have any images or videos of it. However, if needed, we can provide images of a prototypical chapbook that was made by one member, <span class="redacted">Case Duckworth</span>, last year. Thanks for considering our submission. We hope to hear from you soon.<br />

                Hi <span class="redacted">Matthew</span>,<br />
                <br />
                As far as space requirements go, we were envisioning the <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> MAKE 1 (the thing we're doing; we've got a name now!) to be a sort of "be-in" or participatory art piece. We're thinking that the second step of the outlined piece would be a good thing to do at Firecreek (where we make collaborative collages of pictures and words) -- we're already getting the photographs ready and setting up the ekphrastics on the backs of them for that. To make this happen, we were thinking that the big table in the main room of Firecreek's venue space would work well -- maybe we could put that in the center of the room and all sit around it, with the pile of photos and craft supplies in the middle of the table? I'm not sure what kind of set-up you're having for other artists that day, but music during the event would be a good idea. I'm not sure re: copyright law on commercial music events, but we can provide a mixtape if necessary, given that information.<br />
                <br />
                In addition to the table in the middle of the room, we're thinking some kind of hanging apparatus would be good for the display of recently finished work -- either on the walls around the venue or directly above the table. Some rough twine with clothespins would be ideal, or we could try to make it look more like a darkroom. Some pointers on the available use of the space would be helpful in this area.<br />
                <br />
                Since the MAKE is going to be participatory, we were thinking that having an extra layer of chairs facing into the table (maybe raised? if possible) for spectators to sit in and suggest juxtapositions / come and have a seat at the table would also be a good idea. Let us know if you think this would be too chaotic.<br />
                <br />
                We should need only two or three outlets (we're mostly an analogue operation), and maybe one mic and possible wall space (see note above). We'll need a big table for about 5-8 people to sit at and as many chairs. We'd like that table and those chairs to be on the floor of the venue (stages have a power dynamic we're not going for in our MAKE). One more question is: what about signage? Will a lot of it be provided, or should we make our own? Are T-Shirts a good idea?<br />
                <br />
                We look forward to your reply. We're super pumped about May 23 and the rest of the SSOO event!<br />
                <br />
                Hugs,<br />

                Hey <span class="redacted">Case</span>,<br />
                <br />
                First off, we really love your team’s project.<br />
                As far as using the table on the 23rd we have performances that will<br />
                need to utilize the floor. Therefore we can provide two options: Either<br />
                we can relocate your piece to another area or have it continually<br />
                happening and omni-present at the show. Basically we will be moving<br />
                all the tables out of the space and to the walls for the performing artists.<br />
                <br />
                Or we your team to show on the 9th. The benefits of this would be that<br />
                we don’t have as many conflicts with the space and performers.<br />
                Another benefit is that we will not have a show during the weekend of <br />
                May 16th. Therefore your work will be able to be shown for two weeks <br />
                instead of one. The downside is that the printed material that we have<br />
                created won’t reflect this change if you like this option. However we<br />
                can update it on our website and the facebook page + event.<br />
                <br />
                For t-shirts, the crew of the festival will have some but that’s it.<br />
                Feel free to make them if you want!!<br />
                <br />
                Does your team have a website that we can update on our site?<br />
                <br />
                We are very excited to showcase your team’s work!<br />
                Please let me know what works best.<br />
                <br />
                cheers,<br />

                Hi <span class="redacted">Matt</span>,<br />
                <br />
                So some of us are graduating on the 9th, so that won't work -- what other area were you thinking for the 23rd? We could also do the omni-present at the show thing -- that might be a really interesting intersection. I wonder if we could be in the audience, almost guerilla-style? Hm.<br />
                <br />
                Best,<br />

                <br />
                PS. We don't have a website -- yet. Maybe we can whip one up and send it your way?<br />
            <h2 class="date">2015.05.01 :: info@ssoo.media</h2>
                Hi <span class="redacted">Case</span>,<br />
                        Let’s plan to meet up and talk more about what you’re planning on doing so we can figure out how best to program your performance into the event. Are you around Saturday before SSOO or Sunday? <br />
                <br />
                Thanks! <br />
                <br />

            <h1>SSOO is happening! and an apology</h1>
            <h2 class="date">2015.04.21 :: loosepoops@gmail.com</h2>
                Hey everybody!<br />
                <br />
                OKAY so April has been insane, at least for me. I haven't emailed you like, at all. I'm sorry first and foremost for this radio silence. I promise PROMISE it won't happen again, okay?<br />
                <br />
                BUT GOOD NEWS: we DID get into SSOO!! Turns out I wasn't checking my <a href="mailto:loosepoops@gmail.com">loosepoops@gmail.com</a> account. Which is on me. (I = dumb sometimes.)<br />
                <br />
                We're set for May 23, so we can still do <a href="../makes/index.html#ssoo">MAKE 1</a> no sweat! We can have a meatspace meeting (meetspace? meating?) if yall want, OR we can just trust each other! Let me know.<br />
                <br />
                OKAY so in any case here's what we gotta do THIS WEEKEND to make this work:<br />
                <br />
                    - Buy a disposable camera. (They have em at Walgreens and probably Walmart and other places)<br />
                    - Start taking pictures! Take a lot. Have your camera FILLED UP by May ... let's say May 12. That's three weeks from TODAY. So only slightly &gt; 1 pic / diem.<br />
                    This part's needing YOUR input! Do yall want to<br />
                        - meet that week/end, say one of May 15-18, to do STAGE 1 of the MAKE? (That's ekphrastic-ing the pictures we took (aka writing stuff on the back))<br />
                        - meet AT Firecreek &amp; do STAGE 1 ??<br />
                        - meet a few times before Firecreek ??<br />
                    LET ME KNOW POSTHASTE please :)<br />
                <br />
                Again, I'm real sorry about radio silence thus far, but actually I think this'll work out too b/c we're on average less busy in May? Maybe? May - be?<br />
                <br />
                That being said, though, if you want to drop out that's okay too. No judgment. Just shoot me an email. I'll check this account more often!<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Stay loose,<br />
                <br />
                <span class="redacted">Case</span><br />
                <br />
                PS. as an apology, here's a youtube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA57Pafq_NU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA57Pafq_NU</a> (somehow there's a way to embed these in emails but I don't know it)<br />

                hey <span class="redacted">Case</span>,<br />
                <br />
                I'm down for whatever, so just let me know what other people decide. I think <span class="redacted">Michael</span> and I will be leaving town for the week of May 18-22, so as long as we have our meeting before then, I think it should all work out. We'll be back right before the final deadline, so hopefully we'll be able to make everything work out at the last minute. <br />
                <br />
                Thanks!!!<br />

                We will also be up Saturday and will have your artist package<br />
                with tickets, etc. If you have any time this weekend.<br />
                <br />
                happy graduation!<br />

                Hi <span class="redacted">Matthew</span>,<br />
                <br />
                Here's the statement for the placard:<br />
                <br />
                <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> are sometimes a surprise.<br />
                <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> are an artist-collective based in Flagstaff, AZ.<br />
                <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> are because revision is sometimes tiresome.<br />
                <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> are explorations into the child parts of ourselves.<br />
                <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span> are gorilla art.<br />
                <br />
                Also, are you around today so I can pick up the artist package? I was in Las Vegas this weekend.<br />
                <br />
                OH and the website (which is paltry, but will be updated this week):<br />
