            <h1>manifesto: what is art</h1>

            <p>One question we can ask is: What is ART?!</p>

            <p>ART is fun! ART is something we do to connect to each other in a false world! ART communicates emotion the same way a newspaper communicates facts!</p>

            <p>ART is collaboration! It takes two to tango, it takes many to ART! When I look at you you look back at me: a look is passed between us! Is it romance?! is it hatred?! is it knowledge of our mutual mortality?! It is ART!</p>

            <p>ART is only ART when it’s in all caps! ART is earnest, it’s the old college try to speak to you! Can you hear me?! I’m yelling ART!</p>

            <p>ART is for everyone! ART is the truthful expression of a sincerely felt emotion! If the message is obfuscated or lying to you, it’s not ART! If a newspaper told false facts, it’s a tabloid! If ART tells false emotions, it’s paranoid!</p>

            <p>This does not mean: ART is true! In order to convey a truth we must tell lies! ART = Artifice! = Architecture! = the Arctic Ocean! It’s a hard thing sometimes! Life is hard!</p>

            <p>The world is always ending!</p>

            <p>What does this mean for L!O!O!S!E!!P!O!O!P!S!?! We are ART! We run it out of our mouths and faces and yes, rectums! We breath shit eat live ART! Endless creative! Every end is a new beginning! The world ends forever and begins again! A phoenix! A pooping back and forth forever! ART! <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span>!</p>

            <h1>manifesto: intellectual property</h1>
            <p>
                Intellectual property has no place in the digital world.
                Give up your brain to the ur-conciousness.
                There is no "I" in the Internet.
                There is only "US": the USernet.
