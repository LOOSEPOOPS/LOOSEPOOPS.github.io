            <h1>manifesto: what is art</h1>

            <p>One question we can ask is: What is ART?!</p>

            <p>ART is fun! ART is something we do to connect to each other in a false world! ART communicates emotion the same way a newspaper communicates facts!</p>

            <p>ART is collaboration! It takes two to tango, it takes many to ART! When I look at you you look back at me: a look is passed between us! Is it romance?! is it hatred?! is it knowledge of our mutual mortality?! It is ART!</p>

            <p>ART is only ART when it’s in all caps! ART is earnest, it’s the old college try to speak to you! Can you hear me?! I’m yelling ART!</p>

            <p>ART is for everyone! ART is the truthful expression of a sincerely felt emotion! If the message is obfuscated or lying to you, it’s not ART! If a newspaper told false facts, it’s a tabloid! If ART tells false emotions, it’s paranoid!</p>

            <p>This does not mean: ART is true! In order to convey a truth we must tell lies! ART = Artifice! = Architecture! = the Arctic Ocean! It’s a hard thing sometimes! Life is hard!</p>

            <p>The world is always ending!</p>

            <p>What does this mean for L!O!O!S!E!!P!O!O!P!S!?! We are ART! We run it out of our mouths and faces and yes, rectums! We breath shit eat live ART! Endless creative! Every end is a new beginning! The world ends forever and begins again! A phoenix! A pooping back and forth forever! ART! <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span>!</p>

                There is no "I" in the Internet.

                    motto: it means that we write first,
                    think later; it means to follow your creative
                    heart where it leads and see whether you find
                    monsters at the end of the tunnel, or angels.
                    It means that <span class="lp">LOOSE POOPS</span>
                    is a space to explore the once-over, the live
                    part of art, the drive to endlessly create and
                    <strong>only</strong> create, to not think about
                    what ART could be, but only what it is.
                    Is this making sense yet?
                    Do you understand us?
                    Can you hear the oceanic creativity pawing at
                    conciousness like a breaker?
                    Are you there, God?

                    is Tenet 1 of the Philosophy: if everything
                    we do is live, if we do not revise we must
                    take the position that ideas mean nothing.
                    They are the bait; we must catch the fish.
                    They are the seed; we must water the tree.
                    They are the sigh; we must end the crying.
                    Ideas mean nothing of themselves.
                    It's what we do with them that counts.

                    It follows from the above

                    Fuck pedestals.
